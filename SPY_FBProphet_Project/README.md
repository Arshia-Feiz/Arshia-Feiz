## Overview

The project starts with the exploration of SPY stock data, followed by analyzing how volume affects price changes. Two models were created using Facebook Prophetâ€”one using 50% of the data and another using 80%. The results showed that the buy-and-hold strategy outperformed the predictive models, though the 80% model performed better, suggesting the potential for further refinement.

## Conclusion

While the buy-and-hold strategy remains superior, the improved performance of the 80% model hints at the possibility of enhancing the model by incorporating additional factors.
